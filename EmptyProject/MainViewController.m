//  ViewViewController.m
//  EmptyProject
//  An empty project for Xcode that does not use the Storyboard interface, but just good old ViewControllers
//  From Xcode 5.0 and up the project is default set to using Storyboard and you can no longer choose not to use them
//  it requires some time to change it back, so that's where this default project might come in handy
