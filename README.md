NoStoryboardsEmptyProject-iOS
=============================

An empty project for iOS in Xcode that does not use the storyboards. Storyboards are default from Xcode 5.0 and up. This empty project has been setup to don't use them.
The idea is that you should be able to use this project as a preset for starting new empty project without having to change ana awful lot of settings.
